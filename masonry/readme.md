# CSS Grid Layout - Masonry

Here I tried to implement a very complex grid, inspired by this [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@_jh3y/how-to-pure-css-masonry-layouts-a8ede07ba31a) by Jhey Tompkins. To have some fun, I implemented a very basic intro transition with ES6 and tried to apply some functional programming paradigms.

## Notes

The columns try to fill out each row, before a new row starts. Therefore the source order to get such a complex grid, needs to be heavily art directed.
